        <h2> Nevado Juncal traditional route</h2>
        <p>A classic of classics from the central Andes… that is probably the best description that some, or at least I, would give of this incredible massif located just a few kilometers from the city of Los Andes. Famous for being the six thousand forgotten, a summit that for decades was considered above this level, and that only in 2010 was this title removed thanks - or because of the fault? - of the advent of GPS, recalling it with a pitiful 5,968 meters above sea level. . Without detracting from this, everyone who has faced its slopes, rocks and glaciers in order to crown its summit, will agree that this is and will forever remain a six thousand. Its immense glaciers-seracs-crevasses, its rocky passes, the height and the climatic instability, make this summit a challenge that requires time, patience, organization and experience.

        <h2> German Refuge </h2>
        <p>The German Refuge trail is one of the best known in Yerba Loca. It is a path of moderate difficulty with 780 meters of unevenness and a length of 3.8 km one way from Villa Paulina, where there are also camping sites in case you want to spend the night. To get to Yerba Loca, follow route G-21, Camino a Farellones. At turn 15 you will find the entrance, where you will have to pay * for access and register. From that point to the Villa Paulina sector there are 4 kilometers of a dirt road passable by vehicle, and for this path it is convenient to leave the cars in the parking lot that is called "Galpón". You must take into account the times of entry and exit in the trek that you want to do, these are at the end of the article.

        <h2>  A Reflection on hiking and climate change </h2>
        <p>When we travel through mountain ranges, we feel tiny in relation to everything else - this is what trekking is all about. We carry a small home on our shoulders, with vast space around us to explore in complete freedom.

        It is very important to have a zero impact on the environment, to be kind and to immerse yourself calmly in nature. This is how we immediately get acquainted with the surrounding territory. We have the privilege of hearing only the voices charged in the most isolated communities, voices that are still capable of relating and transmitting the lands they inhabit and monitor with simplicity and emotion. Many of our stories also take place in a little yellow tent, where we fall asleep at sunset and wake up in magical places. We try to cross on foot when the mountain passes are still closed. We not only walk to get from one point to another, above all we walk to feel good and learn about different cultures
